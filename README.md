# Project Title

Two Network Engineering Projects completed during a Intro to Networking course at SFU

## Project 1 (CHORD_DHT)
`Chord DHT project mimics the Peer to Peer Distirbuted Hash Table that stores key values.
Runs in O(log N)`

## Project 2 (Distance Vector Algorithm)
`Distance Vector Algorithm Computes the shortest path from a given "router" or point using either the Bellman Ford Algorithm.
Runs in O(VE)`
